    Determines whether an element is present in the first half of one list

        elem (Any): The element to check for.
        l1 (list): The first list to search.
        l2 (list): The second list to search.

    Returns:

# Check if the given element is present in opposite halves
# Write a function is_present_in_opposite_halves(elem, l1: list, l2: list) that checks whether the given elem is present in opposite halves of the two lists l1 and l2.
# The function should return True if the element exists in one half of l1 and in the opposite half of l2, and False otherwise.

# Note that both the below cases are valid and evaluate to True.

# elem in the first half of l1 and second half of l2
# elem in the second half of l1 and first half of l2
# Assume both lists l1 and l2 have even lengths.

# Examples

# is_present_in_opposite_halves(3, [1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 3, 8]) -> False
# Explanation: 3 is in the second half of l1 and the second half of l2.
# is_present_in_opposite_halves(7, [1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 3, 8]) -> False
# Explanation: 7 is not in l1 or l2.
# is_present_in_opposite_halves(6, [5, 6, 7, 8], [1, 2, 6, 4]) -> True
# Explanation: 6 is in the first half of l1 and the second half of l2.
# is_present_in_opposite_halves(6, [5, 7, 6, 8], [1, 6, 2, 4]) -> True
# Explanation: 6 is in the second half of l1 and the first half of l2.
